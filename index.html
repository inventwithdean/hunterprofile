    <h2>A Hunter</h2>
    <h3>"Saving People, hunting things. The family business!</h3>
    <p>
        I am a human and hunter as well as the member of the <b>Men of Letters</b> with my younger brother Sam. I am also destined vessel of the <b>Archangel Michael</b>. I am best friends with the angel <b>Castiel</b>, and reluctant ally of <b>Crowley</b>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have an ex-girlfriend, Lisa Braeden, who I lived with for a year when I thought Sam was in hell. When I was killed by Metatron whilst using the <b>Mark of Cain</b>, I returned as a demon and a Knight of Hell loyeal only to myself.
